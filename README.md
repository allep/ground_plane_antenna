# Ground Plane Antenna

The goal of this project is to create a simple to print ground plane antenna to be used for low power VHF
transmissions.

This project provides two solids:
1. The lower part, holding the four redials and a mast connector (for PVC pipe connections)
2. The higher part, used to hold the vertical quarter-lambda radiator.
